## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mitchell, I am an Undergraduate Environmental Engineer at the University of Toledo. I am working towards a career in resilience within the water-energy nexus. 

I am currently working on:
- Automating normal engineering calculations and tying them to helpful data visualization methods
- A videogame called W.A.D.E.
  - This will be a way for me to pair my experience with programming and engineering in a fun way
