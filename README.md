## Hi there 👋

My name is Mitchell, I am an Undergraduate Environmental Engineer at the University of Toledo. I am working towards a career in resilience within the water-energy-climate nexus. 

I am currently working on:
- Automating normal engineering calculations and tying them to helpful data visualization methods
- Building scenario dashboards to visualize the tradeoffs between water demand, energy generation, carbon emissions.
- Using public databases to feed real world data into scripts that help practice carbon accounting.
